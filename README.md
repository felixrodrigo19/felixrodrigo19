## About Me

I am Rodrigo dos Santos Felix, a Python Developer from Brasil. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Information Systems from Centro Universitario de Bauru (CEUB) in 2022.

As a Python Developer, I possess the following skills:


- Python OOP
- TDD (Test Driven Development)
- Flask Framework
- Database and ORM such as SQLAlchemy
- Web crawling with Scrapy
- AWS (EC2, ECS, Lambda, S3 and SQS)
- IaC with Terraform and Ansible
- Docker
- GitHub Actions

Previously, I interned at LPNet Internet Provider in Lençóis Paulista - SP from 2019 to 2020, where I provided technical support for IT, telephony, access control systems, and support for Windows and Linux operating systems. I was then hired as an IT assistant, where I worked until 2022 with the same responsibilities, while also participating in planning, developing and implementing small systems for internal use.

Currently, I work as a Python Developer at Cotefácil in Bauru - SP. My responsibilities include integrating the Cotefácil system with partner drug distributor systems, consuming APIs from partner drug distributors using the Python programming language, running web scraping with the Scrapy framework, writing CI/CD pipeline scripts or routines, and configuring cloud infrastructure on AWS.

I've had the opportunity to build web crawling projects from web pages using XPath and back-end response (API), making the processes easier and faster. I'm currently studying TDD and using it to create new projects and features.
